# Homework2: Designing a Solution

### Problem
Right now, the University of Washington’s official statistics, resources, and other responses are scattered (via department, college, unit, etc). After conducting internal user research, our organization found it difficult to navigate the FAQs and resources meant to make UW Seattle student lives easier during this time of uncertainty. This poses problems to students as they might need to do a lot of searching and jumping around different webpages, emails, and social media posts. 

The UW’s [“COVID-19 Landing Page”](https://www.washington.edu/coronavirus/) currently aims to provide a one stop shop, although it is not as comprehensive as it could be. This seems to be missing: university buildings’ hours, resources that are staying open, lack of RSO information, and where to turn for academic support. 

According to researchers at [Cambridge University](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/disaster-medicine-and-public-health-preparedness/article/do-pandemic-preparedness-planning-systems-ignore-critical-community-and-locallevel-operational-challenges/D472C569D002A2525F941B537D1E9064), “pandemic preparedness planning systems ignore critical community and local-level operational challenges”. It is clear that the University of Washington, its students, and its local community are directly affected by a swirl of information that became immediately available, but not necessarily easy to navigate in a single space. The current information system does a disservice in lack of additional resources for community members who are still in the area as well during this pandemic.
